Master To Do List

User Interface - - - - - - - - - - - -
1. Schedule | Don't allow users to add events before todays date and time
  - Users can't enter date before today, but can still manually enter time
    to be before the current time. Gets caught by server, but not client
    (3/6/17)
2. Schedule | Don't allow users to add repeating event without end date
3. Schedule | Streamline "upcoming events" HTML updates in JS (use fcn?)
4. Schedule | Implement repeat event planning


Python Syntax, Commenting, and Verification - - - - - - -
1. All | Implement parameter verification
2. scheduler.py | create unique eventID with addEventWeb
   - The ID will be tacked onto the list of params sent to the actual
     event list and the event list used for creating web data. When
     the web data is created, a hidden input box will be populated
     with the unique eventID and can be sent back to a destructor
     when the user wants to delete an event. Because we can't pass
     an event object over the web to the destructor, this allows us
     to do so.
     Idea: the ID can simply be time datetime that the event was made.
3. vertigrow.py | Remove event from all lists once event has been run
